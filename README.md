 Scan the Internet

## Notes
* Do not remove the rate limit, you will DoS yourself

## Why
There are two reasons for this project to exist. The first reason is my curiosity of how the internet is laid out and works; I want go get a large dataset of functional IP addresses to do more research on.
The second reason is to practice Go, as this is my first Go project
